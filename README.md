# CliReserve Web App API

Developed alongside CliReserve (the mobile app) to act as an interface for RESTful API calls. The web app is developed using ASP.NET CORE (MVC) and utilizes Azure SQL Database with Entity Framework and Azure Blob Storage. Due to relience on multiple Azure Cloud Computing Services, the website became non-functional after the expiration of the Student Trial Azure Subscription.
